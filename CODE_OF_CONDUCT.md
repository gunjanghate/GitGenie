## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect toward others
- Being considerate of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing when mistakes are made

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces — including code repositories, issues, discussions, pull requests, and any official communication channels — as well as when individuals represent the project in public.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported confidentially to the project maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, respecting the privacy and safety of the reporter.

2. **Warning** — A formal warning regarding unacceptable behavior  
3. **Temporary Restriction** — Temporary suspension from participation
