# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

GitGenie is an AI-powered Git assistant that automates commits and pushes.
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security-related reports.**

Instead, please report vulnerabilities by:
- Contacting the maintainers through a private communication channel listed in the repository, or
- Using GitHub’s private security advisory feature (if enabled)

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- Any relevant CLI commands or flags used
- The potential impact (e.g., unintended Git operations, credential exposure)

---

## Scope

Security-related issues may include, but are not limited to:
- Authentication or credential handling
- Automated staging, commit, or push behavior
- AI-generated commit message handling (`--genie` flag)
- Unintended repository or branch modifications
- Any behavior that could lead to data loss or unauthorized access

---

## Responsible Disclosure

Please allow maintainers reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before public disclosure.

We appreciate your efforts in helping keep GitGenie safe and reliable.
