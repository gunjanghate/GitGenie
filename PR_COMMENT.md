CodeRabbitAI review follow-up

Summary of automated review context

- The bot inspected the PR diff between commits `a3a9cdd` and `87b311a`.
- Files analyzed: `GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`, `Readme.md`, `SCROLL_STACK_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, `app/page.tsx`, `components/scroll-section.tsx`, `scripts/checkScroll.js`, `styles/globals.css`.
- `package-lock.json` was excluded by the bot config (path filter).

My findings / likely CodeRabbit conclusions

1. The scroll-stack animation implementation is present and consistent across pages — `ScrollSection` exists and is used to wrap the required sections.
2. CSS rules for `.scroll-stack-section` and `.sticky-wrapper` are present and include mobile fallback at 640px.
3. `app/page.tsx` correctly wraps the 9 sections and assigns z-indexes.
4. `scripts/checkScroll.js` was updated to validate the runtime HTML output.
5. `Readme.md` and `SCROLL_STACK_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md` document the change.

Why `package-lock.json` was excluded

- The CodeRabbit config included a path filter that specifically excludes `package-lock.json` from analysis (seen as `!**/package-lock.json` in the review note). This is a configuration choice to avoid analyzing large auto-generated lockfiles.

How to re-enable `package-lock.json` for review

- If you control the CodeRabbit configuration, remove or change the exclusion pattern. For example, change/remove the filter line from `!**/package-lock.json` or add an explicit include pattern for that file.
- If you're using a YAML config, add an include rule or remove the negation. Example (pseudo):

```yaml
# allow lockfile analysis
path_filters:
  - "**/*"
  - "!node_modules/**"
  # remove or comment the next line to include package-lock.json
  # - "!**/package-lock.json"
```

Suggested next steps (manual)

1. Review the 7 changed files in the PR and confirm documentation is accurate.
2. Optionally re-enable `package-lock.json` in CodeRabbit if you want lockfile linting.
3. Run the included tests locally (see below for instructions).
4. Create PR comment with the tests attached (I generated tests below).

Generated unit tests (added to repo)

- `components/__tests__/scroll-section.test.tsx` — tests basic rendering and inline `zIndex` style
- `__tests__/page.exports.test.tsx` — verifies `app/page.tsx` exports a component

How to run the unit tests locally

1. Install dev/test dependencies (if not present):

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest babel-jest @types/jest
```

2. Add minimal Jest config to `package.json` or `jest.config.js` (example in `package.json`):

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
  "moduleFileExtensions": ["js","jsx","ts","tsx","json","node"],
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$": "babel-jest"
  }
}
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
npm test
# or
npx jest
```

Thanks for the review — here’s a concise follow-up from my side.

Summary:

- I verified the scroll‑stack implementation across the landing page. `ScrollSection` is added and used to wrap the 9 required sections; `styles/globals.css` contains the sticky wrapper and mobile fallback; `app/page.tsx` assigns z-indexes and the layout is consistent.
- `scripts/checkScroll.js` was updated to validate the runtime HTML output for `scroll-stack-section`, `sticky-wrapper`, and `z-index` settings.

About `package-lock.json`:

- It was excluded by the review path filters (the bot uses `!**/package-lock.json`). If you want the lockfile reviewed, please update the CodeRabbit config to remove that exclusion.

Unit tests:

- I added two example unit tests to the repo to jumpstart automated coverage:
  - `components/__tests__/scroll-section.test.tsx`
  - `__tests__/page.exports.test.tsx`
- Instructions to run the tests are included in this comment and in `PR_COMMENT.md` in the repo root.

If you want, I can:

- Reconfigure CodeRabbit to include `package-lock.json` for review,
- Expand unit tests to cover page rendering with mocked subcomponents,
- Attach a short screen-recording/GIF showing the stacking effect (I can provide local steps to record), or
- Open a follow-up PR that adds jest/babel config and run the test suite in CI.
